> Question: 
There are n applicants and $m$ free apartments. Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible will get an apartment.
Each applicant has a desired apartment size, and they will accept any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size.

- __Input__: 
The first input line has three integers $n$, $m$, and $k$: the number of applicants, the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.
The next line contains n integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $\ldots$, $a_n$: the desired apartment size of each applicant. If the desired size of an applicant is $x$, he or she will accept any apartment whose size is between $x-k$ and $x+k$.
The last line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$: the size of each apartment.

- __Output__:
Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.
